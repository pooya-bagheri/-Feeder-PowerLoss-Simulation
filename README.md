This project deploys OpenDSS API to conduct and capture results of a simulation study. All the codes are written in an object-oriented manner. A test electrical distribution feeder is subject of the study. 
The results of simulation is collected through a SQL engine into a relational database. This database makes it easy to conduct further analytics on the simulation results.
